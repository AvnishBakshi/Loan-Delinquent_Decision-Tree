# Loan-Delinquent_Decision-Tree
Based on the given loan data can we understand the major factors or characteristics of a borrower which makes them to get into delinquent stage.  • Delinquency is a major metric in assessing risk as more and more customers getting delinquent means the risk of customers that will default will also increase.  • The main objective is to minimize the risk for which you need to build a decision tree model using CART technique that will identify various risk and non-risk attributes of borrower’s to get into delinquent stage

Conclusion

Accuracy on the Training Data: 83%
Accuracy on the Test Data: 82%

AUC on the Training Data: 87.9%
AUC on the Test: 88.1%

Accuracy, AUC, Precision and Recall for test data is almost inline with training data.
This proves no overfitting or underfitting has happened, and overall the model is a good model for classification

FICO, term and gender (in same order of preference) are the most important variables in determining if a borrower will get into a delinquent stage
